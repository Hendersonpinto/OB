## Notes from the author

1. The video contained in the Hero is only used for visual impact. In reality, visual content aligned with the company values would be used.  

2. The loader at the beginning would be used while fetching data from the server. Due to the lack of data to fetch in this case, a time delay of 3 seconds was used for the website to render.
